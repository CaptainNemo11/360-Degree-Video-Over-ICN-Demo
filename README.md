# 360-Degree-Video-Over-ICN-Demo
A slide that covers the milestones and conclusions on the research
# About the project
The "360 Degree Video Over ICN Demo" project, conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Dirk Kutscher](https://dirk-kutscher.info) at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), explores the implementation of 360-degree video streaming over Information-Centric Networking (ICN). The primary objective is to develop a preliminary demo system that effectively transmits 360-degree video content over Named Data Networking (NDN). The system will leverage NDN's capabilities to optimize the streaming of high-resolution 360-degree videos, ensuring efficient data delivery and improved user experience.
